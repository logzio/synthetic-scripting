# synthetic-scripting

Synthetic-scripting mini app to emulate and monitor a custom user experience by scripting browsers that navigate your website, take specific actions, and ensure specific elements are present. Synthetic-scripting app help to define tests( with playwright) to test custom user experience.

## Run Application

1. Pull the Docker image.

`docker pull logzio/synthetic-script:latest`

2. Run the Docker container.

`docker run -p 8080:8080 -d --name synthetic-script logzio/synthetic-script:latest`

Docker image will run a Node.js mini app. Open http://localhost:8080 in your Browser to access the UI that helps you establish connection between your app and Logz.io.

## Define a script for running the test

1. In tab `General Settings`, fill in all the required fields.

To test Locally please provide all required fields and add test to `Code Editor` section.
